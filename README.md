# 🧠 Neural Network Simulation with Slow Diffusive Feedback

## 🚀 Project Overview

In biological neuronal networks, most synapses are fixed in place, meaning new connections can't pop up without causing damage. However, synaptic strength can change based on how active pre- and post-synaptic neurons are. Enter neuromodulators like dopamine! 🧪 These little guys tweak synapses based on external cues (like rewards 🎯) and internal activity feedback loops. 

This project dives into how slow diffusive feedback (think of it as a steady stream of dopamine) affects the structure of a neural network over time.

This is an old project that I did around 2020 during COVID-19.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Simulate a Homogeneous Neural Network**  
   - Start with a well-behaved, balanced network ⚖️.
2. **Introduce Slow Diffusive Feedback**  
   - Mimic dopamine release and diffusion 🧬.
3. **Analyze Structural Changes Over Time**  
   - Watch how the network evolves into something new and exciting! 🔍

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Network Initialization:**  
   - Place neurons randomly in a 2D toroidal space 📍.
2. **Feedback Mechanism Implementation:**  
   - Simulate dopamine influence on synaptic weights 💧.
3. **Simulation Execution:**  
   - Evolve the network and monitor changes over time ⏳.
4. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Evaluate network structure and activity patterns 📊.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Notebook Environment:** Google Colab 📓
- **Libraries Used:**
  - NumPy (efficient numerical operations ⚡)
  - Matplotlib (data visualization 🎨)
  - SciPy (scientific computing 🧪)
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning utilities 🤖)
  - Enum (manage neuron types easily 🔢)

## 🔍 Results and Discussion

The goal is to see if slow diffusive feedback can help shape neural networks in cool ways. Will the neurons organize themselves to optimize activity? Let's find out! 🧐
